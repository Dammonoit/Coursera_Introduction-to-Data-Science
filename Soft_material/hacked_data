Question:-
Nathaniel Poor and Roei Davidson from the Data and Society Research Institute were faced with an ethical dilemma when the data they wanted to use for research but couldn't (because of logistics issues) was released by hackers. The data they were interested in was publicly available, but difficult to get at requiring an expensive manual process. The hacked dataset included this public data as well as private messages which they were not interested in. 

Do you agree with the author's decision to not use the hacked data, and state any arguments they haven't considered for or against the use of this data?

Answer: -


Well...first lemme start by saying that there should be another option other than agree and disagree because the topic of using the hacked data is highly paradoxical but the usage is situational and one might consider changing his/her stance if the situation is agreeable but shouldn't if it isn't. it's like Free Speech with subset including responsible speech.
I completely agree in this case of Patreon that it violates the code of ethics and also moral integrity to use the data because anyone who donates anything at Patreon helps other side financially to do something which he finds is better for society..but that doesn't mean it's okay in every case.

Should I as a Democratic person use the data hacked from the servers of North Korean Official?...of course yes, there's no denying in that as it may lead to some curious findings. 
If a responsible organisation like Coursera wishes to use the payments data from users and of the people whom it is being paid to find patterns in the data. they might get to know how to optimize the existing system and also can help to build up any new startup of that kind not to exploit existing users of Patreon which sounds clearly fair to me.what about you?

So to conclude the use of hacked data is more of a situational decision rather than a generic paradox.
