Well...first of all this article is not much of a shocking rather i'm having bad feeling because in some cases it's true and for a data science enthusiast like me who mostly deals with metrics and derive conclusions based on that..now imagining how misleading the perspectives or conclusions be if any data science just publishes any biased research about any delicate issue is appalling.   

But we got no other than science to get optmization in this ailing and morally compreomising world. also i do think that journals and research institutions got to be more responsible when it comes to publishing research.
